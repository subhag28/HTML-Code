        <p>This article is about the novel series. For the character, see Harry Potter (character). For the film series,
            see Harry Potter (film series). For other uses, see <em style="background-color: #1a89171a;">Harry
                Potter</em> (disambiguation). <br> <br> Harry Potter is a series of seven fantasy novels written by
            British author J. K. Rowling. The novels chronicle the lives of a young wizard, Harry Potter, and his
            friends Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley, all of whom are students at <em
                style="background-color: #1a89171a;">Hogwarts School</em> of Witchcraft and Wizardry. The main story arc
            concerns Harry's struggle against Lord Voldemort, a dark wizard who intends to become immortal, overthrow
            the wizard governing body known as the Ministry of Magic and subjugate all wizards and Muggles (non-magical
            people).</p>

        <p>series was originally published in English by Bloomsbury in the United Kingdom and Scholastic Press in the
            United States. All versions around the world are printed by Grafica Veneta in Italy.[1] A series of many
            genres, including fantasy, drama, coming-of-age fiction, and the British school story (which includes
            elements of mystery, thriller, adventure, horror, and romance), the world of Harry Potter explores numerous
            themes and includes many cultural meanings and references.[2] According to Rowling, the main theme is
            death.[3] Other major themes in the series include prejudice, corruption, and madness.[4]</p>

        <p>The release of the first novel, <em> Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone</em>, on 26 June 1997, the
            books have found immense popularity, positive reviews, and commercial success worldwide. They have attracted
            a wide adult audience as well as younger readers and are often considered cornerstones of modern young adult
            literature.[5] As of February 2018, the books have sold more than 500 million copies worldwide, making them
            the best-selling book series in history, and have been translated into more than eighty languages.[6] The
            last four books consecutively set records as the fastest-selling books in history, with the final instalment
            selling roughly 2.7 million copies in the United Kingdom and 8.3 million copies in the United States within
            twenty-four hours of its release.</p>

        <p> The original seven books were adapted into an eight-part namesake film series by Warner Bros. Pictures. In
            2016, the total value of the Harry Potter franchise was estimated at $25 billion,[7] making Harry Potter one
            of the highest-grossing media franchises of all time. <em> Harry Potter and the Cursed Child is a play based
                on a story co-written by Rowling.</em></p>

        <p>The success of the books and films has allowed the Harry Potter franchise to expand with numerous derivative
            works, a travelling exhibition that premiered in Chicago in 2009, a studio tour in London that opened in
            2012, a digital platform on which J. K. Rowling updates the series with new information and insight, and a
            pentalogy of spin-off films premiering in November 2016 with Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, among
            many other developments. Themed attractions, collectively known as The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, have
            been built at several Universal Parks & Resorts amusement parks around the world.
